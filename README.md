# kronrlsmkl
Matlab implementation of the Kronecker Regularized Least Squares with multiple kernels algorithm.

## Usage
Drug-target information should be represented in adjacency matrix format, and drug and target kernels are represented as 3D-matrices, where the third dimension refers to each kernel.

Data matrices can be downloaded from http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~acan/kronrlsmkl/
